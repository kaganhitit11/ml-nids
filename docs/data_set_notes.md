# The UNSW-NB15 Dataset


This dataset has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus, Bro-IDS tools are used and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label.

The details of the UNSW-NB15 dataset were published in following the papers. For the academic/public use of this dataset, the authors have to cities the following papers:

                     the potential damage that can be caused by launching
                     attacks is becoming obvious. Meanwhile, Intrusion
                     Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems
                     (IPSs) are one of the most important defense tools against
                     the sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to
                     the lack of adequate dataset, anomaly-based approaches in
                     intrusion detection systems are suffering from accurate
                     deployment, analysis and evaluation. There exist a number
                     of such datasets such as DARPA98, KDD99, ISC2012, and
                     ADFA13 that have been used by the researchers to evaluate
                     the performance of their proposed intrusion detection and
                     intrusion prevention approaches. Based on our study over
                     eleven available datasets since 1998, many such datasets
                     are out of date and unreliable to use. Some of these
                     datasets suffer from lack of traffic diversity and
                     volumes, some of them do not cover the variety of attacks,
                     while others anonymized packet information and payload
                     which cannot reflect the current trends, or they lack
                     feature set and metadata. This paper produces a reliable
                     dataset that contains benign and seven common attack
                     network flows, which meets real world criteria and is
                     publicly avaliable. Consequently, the paper evaluates the
                     performance of a comprehensive set of network traffic
                     features and machine learning algorithms to indicate the
                     best set of features for detecting the certain attack
